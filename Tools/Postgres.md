# Postgres

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Overview

PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a powerful open-source relational database management system. It uses and extends the SQL language to provide a robust set of features and capabilities, such as data integrity, concurrency control, and automated data processing. Postgres is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data, making it a popular choice for many organizations. It is commonly used for web applications, data warehousing, and GIS applications, among others. Postgres also has a strong community of developers, allowing for easy integration with many other tools and technologies.

### üì¶ Running Postgres in Docker

To run a postgres database in a Docker container, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```
docker run -it \\
-e POSTGRES_USER="root" \\
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD="root" \\
-e POSTGRES_DB="ny_taxi" \\
-v $(pwd)/ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \\
-p 5432:5432 \\
postgres:13

```

This will start a session in Docker with Postgres running. You can connect to it using `pgcli` with the following command:

```
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi

```

From there, you can use various commands to interact with the Postgres database. For example, `\\dt` will show the data tables, and `\\d ny_taxi` will show the data from the `ny_taxi` table.

A more convenient way to access the postgres db is using pgAdmin.
